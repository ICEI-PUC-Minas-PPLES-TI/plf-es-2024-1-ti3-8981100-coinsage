# Dev guide: Running Local Database

1. Make sure your `backend/.env` file contains the following variables:
```Dockerfile
DATABASE_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_NAME=coinsage_db
DATABASE_USER=coinsage
DATABASE_PASSWORD=coinsage
```

2. On the folder `Codigos` run the following bash command:
```bash
docker compose --env-file ./backend/.env up
```

3. When the database is ready you will get something like this in your terminal log:
```bash
[+] Running 1/0
 âœ” Container coinsage_db  Created                                                                                                          0.0s
